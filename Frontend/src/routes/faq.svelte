          <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-loose text-blueGray-500">Eagle Monitor helps you keep track of courses that are full that you want to join. You can select courses that you want to be notified about when an opening arises. Additionally, Eagle Monitor provides a more capable search page than EagleApps to find courses you want to take.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-2 md:mb-4 text-xl font-semibold">Do I need to give you my BC login credentials?</h4>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-loose text-blueGray-500">No, you do not have to give your BC login credentials. Only your @bc.edu email address is needed so we can verify that users actually attend BC.</p>

          <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-loose text-blueGray-500">The only data Eagle Monitor stores is your bc.edu email address and the list of courses you are monitoring. This data is only visible to the maintainer of Eagle Monitor.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-2 md:mb-4 text-xl font-semibold">What prompts Eagle Monitor to send me an email that a course has an opening?</h4>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-loose text-blueGray-500">Eagle Monitor watches the data on EagleApps to see how many seats are taken in each course. When a seat opens up and the course is no longer full, Eagle Monitor sends an email to all students monitoring that course.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-2 md:mb-4 text-xl font-semibold">What happens if multiple people are monitoring the same course? Is there any priority of notification?</h4>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-loose text-blueGray-500">There is no priority of notification. All emails go out simultaneously. Once you are notified, it is your job to register for the course in EagleApps.</p>
